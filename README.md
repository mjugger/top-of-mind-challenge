## Exercise Overview
The site - an individual gas station - is the most atomic piece of the GSTV business model - it is at the core of everything we do. Our hardware is installed at the site, advertisers purchase impressions at a site level, and schedules are generated on a per-site basis. Thus, keeping accurate information about a site is essential successful business operations.

We are asking you to build out the client and server-side functionality to create, edit and view flags for multiple sites. GSTV uses flags as a way to identify sites of particular importance - we may be doing research at the site, it may be near a key advertisers' offices, or our CEO may be taking clients for a site visit. Knowing which sites are flagged helps us focus and prioritize if something has gone wrong.

**Some things to keep in mind**
* A site may have multiple flags
* A site flag may have a start date but not an end date
* A site flag may have an end date, but not a start date
* A site flag may have both an end date and a start date

**You do not need to worry about**
* Authorization or authentication
* Deployment

## Functionality
### List of Site Flags for an Individual Site
* **What the user will see**
    * If the site has valid site flags
        * For each flag
            * Flag Type
            * Start Date
            * Edit Date

                    * Permanent - there is not an end date
                    * Current - the startdate is in the past and the end date is in the future
                    * Future - the startdate and enddate are in the future
        * Add Flag Button
        * Close Button

        * Prompts user with modal
            * Message
                * Do you want to remove {item}?
            * Continue Button
                * Check for
                  - Malformed Data Validation
                    - If any required items are not formatted as expected
                      - Submit fails
                        - Message displayed to the user
                          - Unable to Create/Update: {itemName} {itemValue} does not match the expected format.
                  * If server-side validation passes
                    * Update data
                    * Modal is removed and the view will reflect changes from the action.
            * Cancel Button
                * Modal is removed
    * Add Flag Button
        * Allows a user to add a new site flag

            * User is returned to the list of site flags which now reflects new/updated data

## What We Are Looking For
We will be examining your Git repository prior to your interview. We will be looking at code quality, cleaniless, organization as well as how you implement the packaging of the application. Please do not use an automated app creator.

We will ask for you to demonstrate the functionality during the interview.

Please include the version of Node and MongoDB that you used in your pull request.

## Technical Details

### Required Technology
You must use
* ES2015 funtionality
* React
* Redux
* Node.js
* MongoDB

### Version Control
#### GitFlow and GithubFlow
We use [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/) on a daily basis - this allows us to build quality control into our development, QA and deployment process.

We are asking that you use a modified [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) - sometimes referred to as a [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow) - methodology instead of GitFlow. Conceptually, GitFlow and Github flow are similar.

#### Submitting Your Work
Please fork our repository and use a feature branch workflow while developing your functionality. When you are ready to submit your work make a [pull request against our repository](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

### JavaScript
#### Unit Testing
Please feel free to create unit tests - we use [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha).
